              This course is divided into 3 Sessions. In these sessions you will cover
              all the key components of project development using the Scrum Methodology.
              These sessions are designed to give you a strong understanding of how scrum
              is implemented in the real world. The sessions will be driven by a
              pre-defined case study which provides a good example of a real project
              scenario.
